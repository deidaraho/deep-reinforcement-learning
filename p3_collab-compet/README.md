# Project 3: Collaboration and Competition

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01.  Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation.  Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single **score** for each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those **scores** is at least +0.5.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)

    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p3_collab-compet/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

### Instructions
Here is the list of project codes and results,
- **./report.md**: report of the project, consisting the model and experiment results
- **./Tennis.ipynb**: the python notebook to train the agent with MADDPG
- **./model.py**: the PyTorch model for actor and critic
- **./checkpoint_actor_agent_0.pth**: actor network's final weight for player 0
- **./checkpoint_actor_agent_1.pth**: actor network's final weight for player 1
- **./checkpoint_critic_agent_0.pth**: critic network's final weight for player 0
- **./checkpoint_critic_agent_1.pth**: critic network's final weight for player 1

See the main file `Tennis.ipynb` to get an introduction to the environment and follow the steps to solving the environment.
The main classes are defined in the file `MADDPG_agent.py`.

### Approach and solution

The reinforcement learning approach we use in this project is called Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (MADDPG). see this [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7217-multi-agent-actor-critic-for-mixed-cooperative-competitive-environments.pdf).
In this model every agent itself is modeled as a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent (see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf)) where, however, some information is shared between the agents.

In particular, each of the agents in this model has its own actor and critic model.
The actors each receive as input the individual state (observations) of the agent and output a (two-dimensional) action.
The critic model of each actor, however, receives the states and actions of all actors concatenated.

Throughout training the agents all use a common experience replay buffer (a set of stored previous 1-step experiences) and draw independent samples.

Details of the implementation including the neural nets to model actor and critic models can be found in the modules `MADDPG_agent.py` and `models.py` as well as the report (`report.md`).
With the current set of models and hyperparameters the environment can be solved in around 4200 steps.
